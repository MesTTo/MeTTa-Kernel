# Python functions as MeTTa functions

`@m.op` registers a Python callable as a MeTTa function. The signature sets its arities. A generator function is nondeterministic, with one MeTTa answer per yield.

```python
@m.op
def double(x: int) -> int:
    return 2 * x                     # !(double 21) -> 42

@m.op
def upto(n: int):
    yield from range(1, n + 1)       # !(collapse (upto 3)) -> (1 2 3)
```

Annotations become declarations in the running space. A `TypeVar` produces a parametric type variable. A `Union` produces one arrow for each member, which the engine reads as superposed declarations. `Callable[[int], int]` maps to a function arrow, and a typed tuple maps element by element.

A dataclass, enum, or plain class in a signature becomes a declared type. Its field annotations determine the constructor declaration. Translation is two-way: enums project to symbols, structured objects can project to constructor expressions, and answers can rebuild Python instances.

Defaults register every accepted positional arity. A Python `None` produces no answer unless the integration wrapper uses the engine's effect convention. Registration can be removed with `m.unregister(name)`.

See [`petta.ops`](../reference/petta-ops) for annotation mapping and registration, and [`petta.convert`](../reference/petta-convert) for object projection and rebuilding.

## Property-test what you build

`petta.testing` exports the hypothesis strategies this library fuzzes itself with. The generators carry engine truths worth not rediscovering: which names the tokeniser reads back whole, that `true` and `True` are one term on the engine so their spellings canonicalize, and which numbers the printer round-trips. The library's own suite runs on the public module:

```python
from petta import testing as pt  # noqa: E402

_name = pt.names()
_numbers = pt.numbers()
_strings = pt.texts()
_atoms = pt.atoms
```

A property over your own translator or operation is then one decorator:

```python
@given(_atoms())
def test_python_wire_round_trip(atom):
    assert from_wire(atom.to_wire()) == atom
```

`atoms(ground=True)` drops variables for space-content generators, `expressions()` roots every example at the shape spaces store, and hypothesis is only imported when a strategy is built, so the module costs nothing at import. The complete surface is in [`petta.testing`](../reference/petta-testing).
