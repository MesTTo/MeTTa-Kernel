"""examples/integration/import_order_independence.metta in Python: a callee that arrives second.

The index the example imports loads a file that USES a function before it loads
the file that DEFINES it, and then calls the result. So the one claim is that
an import may be written before the import it depends on, and the caller still
answers.

The import is the write door with the receiver as the target space,
`m += lib(INDEX)`, the path crossing through the lib namespace's
exact-module-form call door.

from metta import S, lib

#: The index the example imports, written from the repository root: a Python
#: program has no importing file to resolve a relative import against. A module
#: name is a NAME, so it is minted at the naming factory.
INDEX = S["examples/integration/_fixtures/imports/import_order/index"]

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire. PLACEHOLDER rather than a
#: measurement: the twins wave prices the whole corpus in one re-pin pass on
#: the merged tree, and a number measured in this worktree would pin a cost
#: the merge moves [assumed 2026-08-24: unpriced placeholder, re-pinned by the
#: integrator; commit=e70eaeba6b6c0afc9081239041b8459eb8bb1b92].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 6443 to 6481, at the flat-door
#: typed-dispatch gate and the library import door landing
#: together: every flat call prices one declaration read through
#: type_declaration_in/3, a declared head's flat call routes
#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own
#: form runs (petta_py_typed_dispatch_applies/2, the P14.9
#: residue retirement), and an import-bearing twin now spells
#: its import as `m += lib.x` on the write door [measured
#: 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3
#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 6481 to 6482, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 6482 to 6486, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few
#: tens through SWI's clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header
#: carries the A/B), so the corpus re-pins once on the exact
#: shipping tree [measured 2026-08-25 through
#: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 after a canonical
#: single-boot QLF regeneration].
