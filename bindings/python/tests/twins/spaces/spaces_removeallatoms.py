"""Purpose: examples/spaces/spaces_removeallatoms.metta in Python: emptying a space.

`remove-all-atoms` takes everything out, equations included, and the example's
sharpest claim is what that does to the function itself: it was imported INTO
this space, so the first call removes it, and the second call has no definition
left and answers itself. `(f 42)` goes the same way.

The removal is the engine's own function rather than `space.clear()`, because
the two are different operations: `clear()` empties the same space through the
same funnel but answers NOTHING, where `(remove-all-atoms &self)` answers ONE
UNIT PER REMOVED ATOM, and the example's own claim is about that answer
(residue, P14.10). PERFECT: a container spelling that agrees with the engine's
own on cardinality, so the pair can be taught side by side the way `-=` and
`del kb[pattern]` are. Reading the aftermath is the container door, `len(space)`.

The library arrives through the write door, `m += lib.spaces`, because a
library IS knowledge and the receiver is the target space. The lib
namespace joins its `lib_` family prefix with underscores kept, which is
why no bracket spelling is needed for a name MeTTa writes as
`lib_spaces`.

#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.

#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 13512 to 13522, at the release cut: the
#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive
#: wire, Python operator dispatch), the rules-body staging split
#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
#: example growing the corpus each move counts through SWI's
