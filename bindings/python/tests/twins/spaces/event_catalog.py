"""Purpose: examples/spaces/event_catalog.metta in Python: the event layer's own declarations.

Whether a context can emit change events at all, and which reaction fires first
when several match one write, are both DECLARED rather than inferred, and the
catalog describes their shapes the way it describes every other kind. So the
whole file is reading and writing one space, and both are container doors.

Two claims are about what the catalog REFUSES. A value set is closed, so a
delivery promise nobody could act on is a loud error at the write, which at the
Python door is an exception carrying the checker's own sentence. And a native
space needs no declaration to be watchable, which shows up as the absence of a
row: `not reflection[...]` is the empty answer, and empty is a legitimate
answer here rather than a shape error.

The two spaces the declarations are ABOUT go into those declarations as
handles, because a space is an ordinary term operand.

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire. PLACEHOLDER: the wave's

#: commit=8a8b75a1f4052c00c70c29e25e95e4d5a1812cd5].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 2415 to 2426, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 2426 to 2428, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few
#: tens through SWI's clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header
#: carries the A/B), so the corpus re-pins once on the exact
#: shipping tree [measured 2026-08-25 through
#: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 after a canonical
#: single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 2428 to 2438, at the release cut: the
#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive
#: wire, Python operator dispatch), the rules-body staging split
#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
#: example growing the corpus each move counts through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the whole corpus re-pins once on the exact release tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 after a canonical single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-26, 2438 to 2417 (-21), by the open-tail-index
#: pricing pass, one sweep over the whole corpus after four attributed
#: engine movements: the writable-specialization merge 5c731b03 prices
