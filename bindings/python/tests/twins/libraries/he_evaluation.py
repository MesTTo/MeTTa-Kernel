"""examples/libraries/he_evaluation.metta in Python: what evaluation looks like from here.

Four claims, and three of them dissolve into ordinary Python. Calling a defined
function IS `(eval (double 5))`; `kb.eval(term)` is `evalc`'s image to the
letter, since evalc's signature is exactly term plus space; and `chain`, which
executes one instruction, binds its result and runs the continuation, which is
assignment followed by use of the name.

The terms those two doors evaluate are built with Python's own operators over a
GROUNDED operand: `G(5) + 5` stages `(+ 5 5)` where `5 + 5` would compute 10
in Python and reach no engine at all. That lift is what leaves something for
`eval` to do.

The fourth is `println!` mapped over six items. `println!` answers the UNIT
value, which is what the specification types it with, so the answer is six
units rather than six trues, and Python says the same thing with `print`, whose
return is None, the unit's Python spelling.

#: A PLACEHOLDER, not a measurement. The twins wave re-authored this file and
#: the integrator prices every budget in one pass on the merged tree, so a
#: figure measured here would pin a tree that does not ship
#: [assumed: this twin's inference cost is unmeasured on this branch;
#: commit=1e264c186c531e69acde5ad03ff6a79210626df4].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 4532 to 4627, at the flat-door
#: typed-dispatch gate and the library import door landing
#: together: every flat call prices one declaration read through
#: type_declaration_in/3, a declared head's flat call routes
#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own
#: form runs (petta_py_typed_dispatch_applies/2, the P14.9
#: residue retirement), and an import-bearing twin now spells
#: its import as `m += lib.x` on the write door [measured
#: 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3
#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 4627 to 4638, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 4638 to 4580, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few
#: tens through SWI's clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header
#: carries the A/B), so the corpus re-pins once on the exact
#: shipping tree [measured 2026-08-25 through
#: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 after a canonical
#: single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 4580 to 4590, at the release cut: the
#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive
#: wire, Python operator dispatch), the rules-body staging split
#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
#: example growing the corpus each move counts through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the whole corpus re-pins once on the exact release tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 after a canonical single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-26, 4590 to 4601 (+11), by the open-tail-index
#: pricing pass, one sweep over the whole corpus after four attributed
#: engine movements: the writable-specialization merge 5c731b03 prices
#: each lazily translated match-bearing equation (~+1,500, first-call
#: probe 2,208 to 3,724 across that merge alone;
#: ai-brief-p14-specializer-translation-tax names the follow-up), the
