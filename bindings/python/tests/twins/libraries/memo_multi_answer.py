"""examples/libraries/memo_multi_answer.metta in Python: caching a function that answers twice.

Two equations share one head, so they are two ALTERNATIVES rather than a
redefinition, and `yield` is the door that says so: each independent yield in a
compiled body stores one equation, which is exactly the pair of atoms the
example writes.

The answers are compared as a sorted multiset rather than in clause order.
`memoize` recompiles by removing each equation and adding it back, which
reverses the order the clauses answer in, and answer order is unspecified while
multiplicity is not, so the set is what the claim can be about.

Sorting takes a key here where the other twins in this folder need none. Atoms
carry the engine's standard order, but one of these two answers is the number
7, which the answer view decodes to a Python int, and comparing an int with an
Expression REFUSES in both directions by the same rule that makes `V.x < 2`
raise. `str` is the ordering that spans both kinds.

#: A PLACEHOLDER, not a measurement. The twins wave re-authored this file and
#: the integrator prices every budget in one pass on the merged tree, so a
#: figure measured here would pin a tree that does not ship
#: [assumed: this twin's inference cost is unmeasured on this branch;
#: commit=1e264c186c531e69acde5ad03ff6a79210626df4].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 32994 to 33108, at the flat-door
#: typed-dispatch gate and the library import door landing
#: together: every flat call prices one declaration read through
#: type_declaration_in/3, a declared head's flat call routes
#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own
#: form runs (petta_py_typed_dispatch_applies/2, the P14.9
#: residue retirement), and an import-bearing twin now spells
#: its import as `m += lib.x` on the write door [measured
#: 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3
#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 33108 to 33124, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 33124 to 33101, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few
#: tens through SWI's clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header
#: carries the A/B), so the corpus re-pins once on the exact
#: shipping tree [measured 2026-08-25 through
#: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 after a canonical
#: single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 33101 to 33106, at the release cut: the
#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive
#: wire, Python operator dispatch), the rules-body staging split
#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
#: example growing the corpus each move counts through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the whole corpus re-pins once on the exact release tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 after a canonical single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-26, 33106 to 36439 (+3333), by the open-tail-index
#: pricing pass, one sweep over the whole corpus after four attributed
#: engine movements: the writable-specialization merge 5c731b03 prices
#: each lazily translated match-bearing equation (~+1,500, first-call
#: probe 2,208 to 3,724 across that merge alone;
#: ai-brief-p14-specializer-translation-tax names the follow-up), the
#: relational-candidate rows of 6917bef7, and the open-tail head-index
#: and deprecation apply-seam fixes recovering their shares; the
#: remainder is compiled-image layout, the class this file's own chain
#: documents [measured: min-of-3 serial fresh processes; command=python bindings/python/tools/twin_coverage.py --measure --rounds 3; fixture=p14-integration open-tail-index pricing tree with engine/reader.so; commit=WORKTREE].
