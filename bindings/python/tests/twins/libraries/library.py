"""examples/libraries/library.metta in Python: lib_roman's flat map.

One claim, and both halves of it are MeTTa's own: `map-flat` is the library
function under test and `(+ 1)` is a partial application, which Python spells
with `functools.partial` over host callables and not over an engine function.
So the twin names both and states the answer as an ordinary comparison.

The import hands its target over as the HANDLE it is. `import!` takes that
space as an ARGUMENT, and a space crosses a term position as a grounded
operand, so no space is named as a symbol here. The library's own name keeps
the bracket: `lib_roman` really has an underscore, and the attribute door maps
every underscore to a hyphen.
