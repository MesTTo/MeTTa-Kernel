## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the typed `petta` Python package for atoms, spaces, evaluation,
  operations, queries, persistence, diagnostics, and engine controls.
- Added async, remote, array, dataframe, DAS, matching, weighted-relation,
  foreign-space, and Python-object integration surfaces.
- Added a generated Python API reference, task guides, executable examples,
  and an end-to-end notebook tour.
- Added deterministic inference and retired-instruction regression gates,
  property tests, differential tests, package-install tests, and static checks.
- Added named MORK spaces and bulk Python space writes.
- Added `Rows.to_dicts()` for Python-native row mappings.
- Added `Rows.why()` to explain an empty eager query as a pattern miss,
  failed join, or rejecting guard.
- Added exact unregister counterparts for Python type, object formatter,
  protocol type, protocol formatter, and reflector registrations.
- Added machine-readable citation metadata and this release changelog.

### Changed

- Put an executable Python installation and query example before native backend
  build instructions in the README.
- Set Python 3.11 as the package floor and consolidated build metadata in
  `pyproject.toml`.
- Split Python engine, atom, query, execution, persistence, compiler, and
  diagnostic responsibilities into focused modules.
- Made optional Python integration modules load on first access.
- Preserved concrete target classes through the static return types of `cast`
  and `build`, and made cast targets positional-only.
- Pointed package metadata at the canonical `trueagi-io/PeTTa` repository.

### Fixed

- Preserved the active space during evaluation, tracing, definitions, and
  integration calls.
- Made save, registration, subscription, import, and remote lifecycle changes
  transactional or atomic at their public boundaries.
- Corrected reader, compiler, type dispatch, equality, and occurs-check defects
  covered by the regression suites.
- Made a dropped space release its integration installation records so a new
  space reusing the same name runs each installer again.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Released PeTTa v1.0 with smart dispatch, two-stage compilation, function
  specialization, modular libraries, and MORK, MM2, and FAISS integration.
