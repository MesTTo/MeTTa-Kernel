"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-01-if-and-booleans/07-and_or.metta in Python: the boolean connectives.

`(and true false)` is False, so `(or ... true)` is True and the original's
`if` takes its first branch. The public `and_`, `or_`, and `if_` builders use
Python's sanctioned trailing underscore for keywords and build the stored
engine terms directly.

`m.answers(term).one()` is the cardinality door: exactly one answer, decoded
to the Python bool the conditional expression then reads.

Guarantees:
  - TRUE, FALSE, UNIT, and HERE used here are package values rather
    than local reconstructions [tested: test_the_canonical_atoms_are_public_values;

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire.
#: PLACEHOLDER for the twins wave: every budget in the corpus is 1 here and
#: the integrator's single re-pin pass prices them all on the merged tree, so
#: a figure measured in this worktree would price a tree that never ships
#: [assumed: unmeasured here, deliberately; commit=d4e4f9cf0500c00c8f1201a60cbcf54de7c3fa84].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 1262 to 1263, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-26, 1263 to 1276 (+13), by the open-tail-index
