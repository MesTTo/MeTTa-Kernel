"""Purpose: the Python face of lib_soft, weak unification in Sessa's sense,
BUILT ON the petta library's public surface rather than into it: every call
here goes through run, add, eval, atoms and the public atom API, which is
the point, a soft-reasoning layer any user could have written.
install() imports the library into a space; similar() declares symbol
closeness as ordinary (similar a b degree) facts the equations read;
link_store() materializes those facts from an EmbeddingStore's cosine
neighborhoods, the neural-theorem-proving move with the similarities kept
inspectable in the space rather than buried in a vector index; score() is a
fast Python mirror of (soft-score ...), differentially fuzzed against the
MeTTa one so the two can never quietly drift; and prove()/prove_all() are
goal-directed soft REASONING: backward chaining over the space's facts and
Horn-shaped equations with soft unification at every step, degrees
aggregated by minimum, answering Proof objects that carry the bindings, the
overall similarity, and every step. That is the shape of End-to-End
Differentiable Proving (Rocktaschel and Riedel, arXiv 1705.11040) and Braid
(Kalyanpur et al., arXiv 2011.13354), running over the same (similar ...)
facts and embedding links the rest of lib_soft reads.
