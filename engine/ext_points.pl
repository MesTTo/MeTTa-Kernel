%%%% What kind of seam each extension point is %%%%
%
%Every seam below is declared multifile and then given a KIND on the line
%after it. The kind is the load-bearing fact about a seam, because a cut means
%opposite things in the three of them, and it lived in this comment until a
%checker had to restate it by hand. A restated list drifts, and this one had:
%the prose named five event hooks, omitting metta_backend_selftest/0 and
%wrongly including metta_dispatch_call/4, and both were contradicted by their
%own call sites. So it is data now, and the prose derives from it.
%
%EVENT: run for an effect and the answer discarded, forall(Hook, true). Every
%handler runs.
%
%OWNERSHIP: consulted for an answer, and the first handler that succeeds
%CLAIMS the request; the caller takes it with ->/2 or once/1, and a provider
%declines by failing.
%
%DECLARATION: a fact table the engine reads as data rather than calls for an
%effect. Every clause has to stay readable for the same reason an event
%handler has to stay reachable.
%
%SERVICE: the other direction. The three kinds above are all HANDLER seams,
%where an extension writes the clauses and the engine calls them; a service is
%a predicate the ENGINE defines and an extension is allowed to CALL. A foreign
%space backend needs one: it speaks text over a wire, so it has to turn a term
%into text and back, and before this kind existed it reached into
%engine/parser.pl to do it. SQLite publishes the same half of its own contract
%and for the same reason, handing an extension an sqlite3_api_routines table
%of the host functions it may call so that an extension never links against
%internals [source: https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html and loadext.html]. Naming
%the surface is what makes "reaches past the seam" a question a checker can
%answer, and two extensions had already answered it wrongly: morkspaces.pl and
%bindings/python/petta/shim.pl each wrapped metta_unwritable_symbol/2 under a private
%name of its own, which is what an undeclared dependency looks like from the
%outside [measured 2026-08-17].
%
%The cut rule follows from the kind rather than being a second list to keep.
%In an OWNERSHIP seam a clause guarded by a test that establishes "this
%request is mine" may cut freely, and lib/lib_redis.pl does:
%redis_space_conn(Space, _) fails for a space redis does not own, so a later
%provider's clauses are untouched, and the cut is a real optimisation there.
%In an EVENT or DECLARATION seam every clause must stay reachable, so a cut
%prunes that predicate's remaining clauses and silently disables every handler
%loaded after it. lib/lib_tabling.pl cut after metta_tabling_declared, a
%GLOBAL CONDITION rather than an ownership test: nothing about it says this
%handler is the one that should answer. With tabling declared, duals.pl's
%invalidation handler (asserted last, so ordered last) never ran and
%(not-provable (pq 2)) answered True and False at once.
%
%Write ( Condition -> Action ; true ) in an event handler, which keeps the
%guard's cost and prunes nothing. A cut is transparent through ,/2, ;/2 and
%the THEN branch of ->/2 and *->/2, and opaque everywhere else, including the
%CONDITION of ->/2, where the manual's own worked example is
%`t3 :- (a, !, b -> c ; d)` pruning a/0 and not t3/0
%[source: SWI-Prolog manual, !/0, scope-of-the-cut table]. So a checker that
%flags a cut in a condition is flagging correct code.
%
%Two checks enforce it and neither subsumes the other. A source scan reads
%every clause in the tree, including one a directive asserts, and a runtime
%scan reads clause/3 after the libraries have loaded, which is the only way to
%see a handler that Python installs or one whose body is built at run time
%[tested: tests/prolog/static_checks.pl, no_cut_in_an_event_hook and
%no_cut_in_a_live_hook_clause].
%
%ext_point_kind/2 is itself multifile, so a library that introduces a seam of
%its own declares its kind beside it and gets the same gate. Every seam has
%exactly one kind and that is checked rather than trusted
%[tested: every_seam_declares_one_kind], so a seam added without one fails the
%gate instead of going quietly unchecked.

%Who writes a seam's clauses. This is the primitive the cut rule derives from,
%rather than the cut rule naming kinds directly: that rule is about a handler
%an extension contributed staying reachable, so it can only bite where an
%extension contributes the clauses. A service's clauses are the engine's own
%and cut freely, as swrite/2 does; reading the rule off the kind list alone

%A handler seam is multifile because an extension adds clauses to it. A
%service is not, because an extension calling it must not be able to redefine
%it, and multifile is exactly the permission to try. The two directions are
%checked apart for that reason [tested: every_seam_kind_matches_its_direction].

%CALL DISPATCH: a handler is offered every compiled call site and either
%CLAIMS it, by binding Goal to something the engine runs instead, or fails and
%the ordinary call proceeds. Failing is the shipped default and the whole of
%what a handler must do to opt out.
%
%It was named metta_memoized_dispatch_call/4, for the first library that used
%it, and the name was the problem: nothing suggested it was the general
%dispatch seam, so nothing reached for it to do anything else. lib_memo binds
%Goal to a cache lookup, and it is still the only handler in the tree. This is
%Trino's applyX / Optional.empty() shape, and it was here before that reading.
%
%A function name alone does not identify a function, because a named space
%compiles its equations into a module of its own, so a handler that keeps
%state per function reads current_metta_module/1 to learn which module the
%call site is in. It reads it rather than being passed it because this hook is
%consulted on every compiled call site.

%Function-change hooks, run once per compiled equation. Dynamic for the same
%reason the atom hooks below are: a handler needed only once a feature is used
%should cost nothing until then, so it is installed when that feature first
%runs rather than when its file loads. A resident handler clause costs four
%inferences on EVERY compiled equation [measured 2026-08-15: engine/duals.pl's

%Space writes: every 'add-atom'/3 and 'remove-atom'/3 runs these hooks with
%the space and the term, after the write. A standing query, a subscription,
%an index or a mirror hangs off them; with no handlers nothing changes.
%A removal hook fires only when something was actually removed, and it carries
%the term the caller ASKED to remove rather than the occurrence that left. The
%two coincide for a ground request and diverge for a pattern: removal is
%multiset subtraction, so (remove-atom &s (p $x)) takes one of the atoms
%matching (p $x) and the hook cannot say which. A handler that needs the
%occurrence re-reads the space; bindings/python/petta/structures.py's LiveView is the

%What the caller will do with a match. Options is a list; the only option
%today is limit(N), meaning the caller stops after N answers. It is `[]` when
%there is nothing to say, which is most calls.
%
%It is ADVISORY, and that is what makes it sound. A provider may
%over-approximate, so N candidates are not N answers, and a provider that
%truncated at N without knowing which of its candidates unify would
%under-answer, which is the one thing the contract forbids. So honour it only
%when you can tell an exact match from a candidate, and ignore it otherwise:
%the engine bounds the answers itself either way, and this changes only how
%much work the BACKEND does before the first one.
%
%Two levers a reader might expect here are already in place and need no
%option. The bound parts of a pattern reach a provider as ground atoms,
%including the bindings an enclosing join has made, so the second pattern of
%a join arrives as (other a0 $_) rather than (other $_ $_). And the engine
%stops pulling as soon as it has enough: a limit of 3 over a provider holding
%a thousand atoms pulls four [measured 2026-08-16].
%
%ONE hook, with the options always passed. There was a /2 beside this and the
%engine chose between them with `clause(metta_foreign_match(_,_,_), _)`, which
%asks whether ANY provider anywhere declared the bounded form. The Python shim
%declares it unconditionally, so with Python in the process that guard was true
%for every space, and a Prolog-only provider writing /2 had the /3 form called
%instead: the shim's clause failed on its own ownership check and the whole
%match answered nothing. Reproduced as `unbounded: 3, bounded: 0`
%[measured 2026-08-16]. A provider that has nothing to do with the options
%ignores the argument, which costs it one underscore and cannot go wrong.

%How much a provider's own filtering is worth, per PATTERN. Class is exact or
%inexact, and a space with no clause is inexact, which is the answer every
%provider written before this gets for free.
%
%  exact    every candidate you yield for this pattern unifies with it, so N
%           candidates are N answers and limit(N) is a requirement you may
%           truncate to
%  inexact  you reduce what you produce, and some of it may not match; the
%           engine re-unifies and limit(N) stays advice you must not truncate to
%
%This is Apache DataFusion's TableProviderFilterPushDown, whose Exact rung
%says it in the same words: "Your source guarantees that no output rows will
%have a false value for this predicate. Because the filter is fully evaluated
%at the source, DataFusion will not add a FilterExec for it", against Inexact,
%"Your source has the ability to reduce the data produced, but the output may
%still include rows that do not satisfy the predicate"
%[source: Apache DataFusion, Custom Table Providers].
%
%PER PATTERN, not per provider, which is the part worth copying. A backend is
%usually exact on equality against an indexed column and inexact on everything
%else, and one flag for the whole provider would force it to claim the weaker
%answer everywhere. The clause takes the pattern, so it can say which is which.
%
%DataFusion's third rung, Unsupported, is deliberately absent. It exists there
%because the planner decides whether to SEND a filter at all; here the pattern
%is the only thing a provider is given, so there is nothing to withhold, and a
%provider that ignores it is inexact in the only sense the engine acts on.
%
%What the engine does with exact: it stops pulling at N instead of at N+1,
%since it no longer needs the extra candidate to learn the bound is met. What
%it does NOT do is skip unification, which is not a filter here but the step
%that binds the pattern's variables, so an exact claim cannot make an answer
%wrong. It can only make a wrong claim cost answers, which is why
%check_space_provider tests it against the provider's own output

%The routing voice of a third-party declaration kind. Consulted after the
%declared fidelity or the provider's own method proposes a route class,

%A conjunction, offered WHOLE before the engine splits it. Succeed to claim
%some of it, binding Goal to a goal that enumerates bindings for Claimed; fail
%to decline, and the engine plans it exactly as it does today.
%
%   metta_foreign_plan(Space, Patterns, Claimed, Rest, Goal)
%
%This is the seam that makes a backend's own join reachable. Without it every
%conjunction is split one pattern at a time and re-dispatched per outer row,
%which is a nested-loop plan, and a nested-loop plan cannot reach the AGM bound
%however fast the provider is: for the triangle R(x,y), S(y,z), T(z,x) with each
%relation of size N the bound is N^1.5 and "it is not possible to achieve a
%running time of O(N^3/2) using only join plans" [source: Ngo/Re/Rudra and the
%worst-case-optimal join literature]. So this is not a tuning knob; it is the
%difference between a provider being allowed to be asymptotically better and
%not being allowed to.
%
%Four properties, each with a precedent elsewhere in this file:
%
%  - DECLINING IS THE DEFAULT. A provider with no clause gets today's behaviour
%    exactly, the same safe default the capability vocabulary has.
%  - A PARTIAL CLAIM IS LEGAL. Claimed plus Rest lets a backend take the two
%    patterns it owns and leave the third, so the seam is not all-or-nothing.
%    They must PARTITION Patterns: dropping a conjunct answers more rows than
%    the query asks for and the engine refuses it, because nothing downstream
%    would catch it.
%  - THE STRATEGY IS INVISIBLE. Leapfrog, a hash join, a SQL SELECT, a vector
%    index: the engine sees a goal. It supports none of them and therefore all.
%  - THE CLAIM IS EXACT, and this one is the exception to the seam's usual rule.
%    Elsewhere a provider may over-approximate because the engine re-unifies
%    each candidate, which is cheap. There is no cheap re-check for a join: the
%    only way to verify a row is to run the join. So claiming means answering
%    exactly, a provider that cannot must decline, and check_space_provider
%    verifies the claim against the engine's own split rather than trusting it.
%
%The caller's options are not passed. The engine still bounds the answers, so
%this costs work in the backend and never an answer, and a limit could not be
%honoured usefully anyway while a provider answers a whole batch at a time.

%What a provider answers. Failure alone cannot say: metta_foreign_match/3 is a
%legitimate enumerator, so "no clause" and "no atoms match" look identical
%from the engine, and clause/2 cannot stand in either, because every provider
%in this tree writes ONE clause with a variable space and an ownership guard
%in the body, which unifies with any space at all.
%
%So it is declared, the way bindings/python/petta/foreign.py derives it from the narrow
%protocols a provider implements. The capabilities are add, remove, match,
%enumerate, clear, PLAN and RULES.
%
%`rules` is the odd one and it is the one that matters most. It says the
%space's atoms include EQUATIONS, which in MeTTa is the difference between a
%data source and a place a program lives. The provider stores one the way it
%stores any atom and the ENGINE compiles it, so a foreign rule is the same
%compiled clause a native one is; nothing in the provider knows what an
%equation is. A space without the declaration is refused an equation at
%add-atom rather than storing one that can never fire. A space that declares
%NOTHING is taken to provide everything, which is what every provider written
%before this assumed.
%
%Two things follow from a declaration, and the first is the one that matters:
%a space that enumerates but does not match now has its enumeration FILTERED
%here for a bound pattern, instead of answering nothing. The Python half has
%always said enumeration is enough ("An Enumerable provider need not implement
%Matcher"), and the Prolog half quietly required both. The second is that an
%operation a space does not provide raises with the space and the operation
%named, rather than failing into "there is nothing there".

%capability a space does not declare, and "does not implement add" reads

%one gets. It is expected to THROW rather than answer

%
%A library that introduces its own cancellation or budget signal adds a
%clause and every recovery site in the engine respects it, which is the only

%%%% Native backends %%%%
%
%A backend is a space provider whose implementation is a shared library. It
%reaches the engine through the foreign-space seam above like any other
%provider; these two are the only things it needs that a Prolog provider does
%not, and both exist so the ENGINE never has to know a backend by name.
%
%The builtins a backend's bridge provides. Declared by the file that DEFINES
%them, so they exist exactly when the predicates behind them do: registering a
%name whose predicate is absent records no arity, and every call to it then
%compiles to a partial application. engine/metta.pl registers whatever is declared
%here, and names nothing.

ext_point_kind(metta_backend_builtin/1, declaration).

%A backend's smoke test, run by engine/main.pl's demo. Every handler runs, so a
%process with two backends tests both, and one with none tests nothing and says
%so by being silent.

%%%% Services the engine publishes %%%%
%
%The seams above are all things the engine calls. These are the other
%direction: engine predicates an extension is allowed to call. An extension
%that reaches past them is depending on an internal that can be renamed under
%it, which for a backend is a gate failure rather than a style note
%[tested: a_backend_calls_only_published_surface].
%
%The MeTTa builtins are published too and are not repeated here: an extension
%calls 'add-atom'/3 or match/4 as the LANGUAGE, and builtin_fun/1 already says
%which names those are.
%
%TEXT. What being a shared library costs. A backend's atoms live on the far
%side of an FFI boundary that carries bytes, so every atom it stores is written
%and every atom it returns is read, and before these were declared MORK reached
%into engine/parser.pl for all four, wrapping one under a private name.
%
%swrite/2 and sread/2 are one rule about spelling rather than two conveniences.
%swrite/2 will print a value that sread/2 does not read back as itself, and
%there are two ways for that to happen. MeTTa has no quoted-symbol syntax, so
%a name with whitespace, a parenthesis or a quote in it loses its identity on
%the round trip; and the writer prints numbers the reader's grammar cannot
%all read back, so a non-finite float goes out as inf, -inf or NaN (the
%arbiter's spellings) and a rational as 1r3, and each comes back a SYMBOL of
%that spelling. A backend cannot decide either for itself, the grammar owns them,
%and asking is what the other two are for: check before writing, and refuse
%rather than store an atom that will come back different.
%metta_symbol_writable/1 answers the first question about one name;
%metta_unwritable_symbol/2 answers both about a whole term, and its name is
%narrower than what it reports because names were the only class known to fail
%when this surface was declared.
%HOST SERVICE: a service again, engine-defined and engine-owned, but for
%the other caller: the HOST BINDING's transport (bindings/python/petta's shim today,
%any future binding's transport tomorrow). The backend direction has
%a_backend_calls_only_published_surface; this kind is what the host
%direction's twin reads, so the binding can no longer grow a dependency on
%an engine internal silently. The list is measured, not aspirational: it is
%exactly the engine predicates the shipped shim calls, and shrinking it is
%the shim-thinning work's scoreboard.

%rethrow in a worked example at two places and the type error in a third
%[source: EXTENDING.md, "Making your errors read like a builtin's"]. Declaring

%CONTEXT. Which module the call site is in. A named space compiles its
%equations into a module of its own, so a function name alone does not identify

%CONTEXT, the other half: which MODULE a space compiles into, and which space
%a module serves. Published because Phase 11 made them necessary rather than
%convenient. A space and its module were the same atom for every space but
%&self, so a library could pass a space name wherever a module was wanted and
%it worked by coincidence; they are different atoms now and
%with_metta_module/2 REFUSES a space name, so a library that runs a goal in a
%space has to ask. lib_memo.pl and lib_tabling.pl each carried a hand-written
%copy of the inverse before this

%Both branches succeed or throw, never fail. This installer runs from inside a

%assertz "the hook is called after the clause has been added. If the hook
%fails the clause is REMOVED", and on a retract "if the hook fails, the clause
%is not removed" [source: SWI-Prolog 10.1 Reference Manual, Appendix B.9]. So
%a failure here silently erases the handler that was just installed, or leaves
%one the caller believes it erased, and either way a library's subscription
%simply never fires with no error to find. The disable branches were already
%total; these were not. Nothing observed fails, so this is the seam's own
%installer being made unable to fail quietly rather than a live bug
%[tested: a_handler_survives_its_own_installation].
%The wrapped predicate is the ENGINE's, so the module is asked rather than
