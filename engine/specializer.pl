% Purpose: specialize higher-order MeTTa calls and invalidate generated
%   functions when their source equations change.
% Guarantees:
%   - Specializer assertions made while loading a source participate in source
%     rollback [tested 2026-08-14:
%     specializer:compound_partial_key_has_stable_anonymous_variables].
%   - Concurrent translation creates one specialization for a function and
%     normalized key [tested 2026-08-15:
%     specializer:concurrent_translation_creates_one_specialization].
%   - A recursive specialization returns to neither the generic predicate nor
%     the reducer after its first step, so the saving is per step
%     [tested 2026-08-18:
%     specializer:exact_recursive_key_folds_to_specialized_predicate,
%     specializer:the_recursive_specialization_never_re_enters_the_reducer]
%     [measured 2026-08-18: 8,004 against 24,004 inferences over 1,000 steps,
%     the same third at 100].
%   - A specialization is a derived support-graph node, so changing its source
%     function invalidates transitive specialization chains through the common
%     forward walk [tested:
%     support_graph:test_a_derived_fact_is_invalidated_forward_from_what_it_supports;
%     commit=7ade2b90e2631451fd6ffc23d22dd8c2d4a7a7aa].

%ways in production would run a function's EFFECTS twice, which is worse
%than the optimisation is worth. So it is a checking MODE instead: off,
%the emitted goal is byte-identical to what it always was and costs
%nothing; on, every specialization is compared against the generic call
%the first time it runs, and a disagreement THROWS rather than silently
%demoting, because a checking mode that hides the defect it found is
%worth less than no check. The mode is what turns the workspace's

%Forget a specialization, IN ONE MODULE. It is keyed by name and by module
%because a specialization is: ho_specialization/3 records both, and the same
%generated name exists in two modules the moment two spaces specialize the
%same call. Keyed by name alone, forgetting the clone one space no longer
%needs removed the OTHER space's clauses and, through remove_sexp/2, the
%other space's stored equation with them: dropping a space that had been
%copied from &self took atoms out of &self
%[tested: specializer_invalidation:writing_in_one_space_leaves_another_alone,
%test_adding_in_one_space_never_removes_atoms_from_another].
%
%The clauses are in the module of the space whose code triggered the
%specialization, which is what specialize_call_locked/7 registers. Asking
%current_predicate/1 and clause/3 UNQUALIFIED read the engine's own module,
%which found &self's clauses only for as long as &self WAS that module and
%never found a named space's at all. A stale specialization then outlived the
%equation it cloned and answered beside the new one: removing one of two
%equations for a higher-order function gave (2 2 42) where (2) was asked for
%[tested: examples/functions/functionremoval.metta,
%specializer:a_removed_equation_forgets_its_specialization].
%
%clause_property(module/1) is the filter that keeps this from erasing a
%PARENT's clauses: clause/3 sees inherited ones through the base chain, and a
%named space asking to forget a name &self defines must not erase &self's.
