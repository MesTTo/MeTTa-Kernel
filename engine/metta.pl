% Purpose: provide PeTTa's Prolog runtime, builtins, type system, evaluator,
%   imports, function registration, and named-space execution context.
% Guarantees:
%   - A built-in call covered by the effects cluster whose declared operand
%     types already conflict is refused before operand evaluation; shallow
%     compile-time checks inspect literals and declared return types without
%     binding source variables
%     [tested: operation_answers, test_a_repeated_eval_does_not_recompile_and_the_effects_cluster_conforms; commit=8d0027a3942000c799daccb45bf0abe1b46b10aa].
%   - import! loads a MeTTa source that is new or that has been edited, and
%     skips one that is neither, which is SWI's if(changed); a Python source
%     keeps if(not_loaded) [tested 2026-08-19:
%     test_an_unchanged_repeat_import_does_not_run_the_source_again,
%     test_an_edited_import_is_not_skipped,
%     filereader_source_reload:an_unchanged_file_is_not_loaded_again].
%   - petta_handles_route/5 routes a query by the most specific matching
%     (handles ...) entry in &petta, where specificity is pattern
%     subsumption first and adornment-set inclusion between renaming-equal
%     patterns, disagreeing maximal ties throw petta_contract_conflict/4
%     naming both entries and the query, and a context with no entries
%     fails in one indexed probe [tested 2026-08-17: metta_handles_route]
%     [measured 2026-08-17: 15 inferences per undeclared-context miss].
%   - get-type/2 returns each derived type once, while has_type/2 uses one
%     witness for a fixed expected type [tested 2026-08-15:
%     metta_type_answers, translator_typed_checks].
%   - a child execution module resolves parent equations before the shared
%     &self and builtin tiers [tested:
%     test_a_child_space_reads_through_its_parent_and_writes_locally;
%     commit=755330de329ece49eddcfb7d6db3061c3350a0ca].
%   - restricted modules resolve only their local equations and curated
%     builtin surface [tested: spaces_restricted_modules;
%     commit=6a08901f4125c2536f5b4032daac9937f793870f].
%   - Integers inside signed i64 report Number and integers outside it report
%     BigInt; a Number parameter admits either while a BigInt parameter admits
%     only BigInt, and arithmetic may cross the boundary in either direction
%     without changing its exact SWI value [tested 2026-08-20:
%     bigint_number, test_bigint_and_number_type_the_numeric_tower,
%     test_integer_type_follows_the_signed_i64_boundary,
%     test_number_parameters_accept_bigint_without_retyping_number].
%   - Import lifecycle state is separate from atom storage, so wildcard atom
%     removal cannot make a loaded source run twice [tested 2026-08-15:
%     filereader_import_lifecycle].
%   - Host failures from builtins retain their ISO error class and name the
%     written MeTTa operation [tested 2026-08-15:
%     metta_operation_errors, translator_evaluation_errors]. Integer
%     arithmetic pays nothing for this and float arithmetic pays one
%     inference per call, because only the integer pair takes the guarded
%     fast path [measured 2026-08-15: 300,000 and 400,000 inferences per
%     100,000 calls, against 300,000 unguarded]; division's integer pair
%     pays the catch too, because a non-divisible pair converts its result
%     to float and can overflow doing it. Whole-corpus cost is
%     +2.1% instructions on examples/performance/scale.metta
%     [measured 2026-08-15].
%   - A result past binary64 saturates to the IEEE value on the engine's
%     operations, agreeing with the reader's saturating literals, and an
%     infinity a literal produced carries through further arithmetic; the
%     same recovery answers the whole IEEE family when a float operand is
%     present, a float zero divides to the signed infinity and the NaN
%     class answers NaN, while integer division by zero keeps raising; raw
%     is/2 keeps every flag's error mode [tested 2026-08-20:
%     engine_operations_saturate_where_raw_is_still_raises,
%     a_read_infinity_survives_further_arithmetic,

%     test_arithmetic_overflow_agrees_with_the_literal_side,
%     test_float_zero_division_and_nan_agree_with_the_arbiter].
%   - is-alpha-member/3 tests unifiability without retaining bindings in its
%     arguments [tested 2026-08-15: metta_alpha_membership].
%   - alpha-unique-atom/2 confirms identity inside each term-hash bucket, so a
%     hash collision cannot remove an inequivalent term [tested 2026-08-15:
%     metta_alpha_unique].
%   - get-metatype/2 classifies every Prolog term used as a MeTTa value, and
%     classifies a NAME by the arbiter's grounded-token table gated on this
%     engine holding the operation, so a token nothing here answers to reports
%     Symbol as an unknown name does [tested 2026-08-20: metta_metatypes].
%   - petta_transaction/1 answers everything its body answers, and every
%     answer's writes commit or roll back together [tested 2026-08-19:
%     bindings/python/tests/test_atomic_forms.py::test_a_transaction_preserves_every_answer_of_its_body].
%   - Every guarded_input_position/3 refuses an unbound argument and names the
%     MeTTa operation, so no builtin binds the caller's variable, invents an
%     answer, runs away or reports a host predicate [tested 2026-08-19:
%     builtin_input_guards:every_builtin_refuses_an_unbound_input_by_name,
%     bindings/python/tests/test_builtin_inputs.py::test_a_raising_builtin_names_the_metta_operation_not_the_host_predicate].
%   - ==/3 and !=/3 refuse two operands of known and different types and
%     answer for every other pair, at no cost on two numbers [tested
%     2026-08-19:
%     bindings/python/tests/test_equality.py::test_cross_kind_equality_answers_what_the_arbiter_answers]
%     [measured 2026-08-19: 4487.45 inferences per thousand-iteration loop,
%     unchanged].
%   - %Undefined% is consistent with every type in both directions, so a call
%     site refuses only a PROVEN conflict, while has_declared_type/2 demands a
%     witness for a contract [tested 2026-08-19:
%     bindings/python/tests/test_gradual_typing.py::test_an_unknown_type_is_consistent_with_every_declared_type,
%     bindings/python/tests/test_answer_protocol.py::test_admission_types_the_pool].
%   - An expression no arrow types reads element-wise, and the tuple it reads
%     is %Undefined% as soon as one member's type is [tested 2026-08-19:
%     metta_type_answers:a_tuple_with_an_untyped_member_is_undefined].
%   - get-type/2 and get-type-space/3 answer from declarations without running
%     the inspected expression, so inspection has no effects of its own
%     [tested 2026-08-19:
%     bindings/python/tests/test_type_inspection.py::test_get_type_does_not_run_its_arguments_effects].
%   - get-type-space/3 reads only the selected space, and the upstream doc
%     family builds @doc-formal answers from that scoped type and prose
%     [tested 2026-08-20:
%     bindings/python/tests/test_doc_family.py::test_the_doc_family_answers_what_upstream_answers].
%   - builtin_type_declaration/2 rows are the union of lib_builtin_types.metta
%     and the prelude's, with each row written once and evicted only by the
%     register that wrote it [tested 2026-08-19:
%     metta_builtin_type_surface:a_shared_declaration_is_evicted_only_from_the_register_that_wrote_it].
%   - The prelude loads exactly three form shapes: a declaration, an equation,
%     and `!(add-translator-rule! NAME)` for a name it defines itself, which
%     is how a DERIVED form ships. A program that defines such a name takes
%     the whole form over, so the registration is withdrawn with the clauses
%     [tested 2026-08-19: prelude_derived_forms].
%   - Test assertions distinguish no answer from one empty-expression answer
%     [tested 2026-08-14: translator_test_answers].
%   - petta_assertion_failure/4 classifies the three assertion formals, so a
%     harness tells a false claim from a broken engine by TYPE rather than by
%     reading the message [tested 2026-08-19:
%     bindings/python/tests/test_assertion_failures.py::test_a_failing_assertion_is_a_different_exception_from_an_engine_fault].
%   - Runtime builtins reject prebound outputs that they would not produce
%     [tested 2026-08-14: metta_builtin_outputs].
%   - Function registration performed by a source load participates in that
%     load's rollback [tested 2026-08-14: filereader_source_rollback].
%   - Python source imports restore sibling modules and sys.path after setup
%     or execution errors [tested 2026-08-14:
%     metta_python_import_cleanup].
%   - Every metta_grounded_extra_type/2 clause is consulted whether or not a host
%     bridge answers metta_grounded_type_names/2, so a (py-atom f Type)
%     declaration survives the Python library being loaded [tested 2026-08-18:

%     [measured 2026-08-18: +2 inferences per get-type on a Python object and
%     0 on every other value].
%   - The engine loads and runs the full examples/ corpus with
%     set_prolog_flag(autoload, false) already in effect: the
%     directory_file_path/3 directive below needs library(filesex) before
%     the rest of this section's use_module block would otherwise supply
%     it, and next_lambda_name/1 (translator.pl) needs library(gensym) for
%     every foldl-atom/map-atom/filter-atom/'|->' compile, both silently
%     supplied by autoload before now [measured 2026-08-18: NO_AUTOLOAD=1
%     sh test.sh, 200/200 examples; run.sh's own header has the mechanism].
%     Cost: +1.50% instructions:u on a bare boot (swipl -s engine/metta.pl,
%     no backends), +0.54% with backends loaded too, +0.14% over a full
%     example run that also exercises the opt-in libraries' own fixes
%     (lib/lib_constraints.pl, lib/lib_memo.pl) [measured 2026-08-18:

%     test.sh"`, reusing test.sh's own parallel runner and skip list

%directory_file_path/3 is library(filesex)'s, not a built-in, and the
%directive a few lines down calls it immediately at load time to compute
%standard_library_path/1, before the rest of this section's use_module
%block would otherwise supply it. Autoload papers over the ordering when
%it is on; with autoload=false the directive fails on an unknown
%procedure and standard_library_path/1 is never asserted, which then
%aborts the boot at load_builtin_type_surface's first (library ...) call.
%So this one import has to come first, ahead of even the section header's
%own first clause.

%Manual, section 4.36], it composes (the second argument may be another

%Which module the ENGINE's own predicates live in, asked of SWI at load time

%%%% Native backends %%%%
%
%A native backend is a space provider whose implementation is a shared library
%rather than Prolog. Once loaded it is a foreign space like any other and this
%file knows nothing more about it; what it needs from the engine is somewhere
%to be loaded FROM, and that is all this does.
%
%One backend used to be named here instead, twice: `'../backends/mork/mork_ffi/morkspaces'`
%in a second copy of the whole load list, and its three builtin names in a
%second argv test further down. So a second native backend could not be added
%without editing this file, which is the one thing EXTENDING.md promises an
%extension author never has to do, and MORK was reaching the engine through a
%door no other provider had. It goes through the seam now like everyone else.
%
%A backend is an integration folder in backends/ with a decider.pl at its
%top. Loading one is consulting that decider, and
%what it pulls in, where its build artefacts are, and whether they are present
%at all is the backend's own business: a backend that is not built loads
%nothing and says nothing, and one that is built and broken raises, which is
%the split every host wants and none of them should have to implement.
%
%The engine's own position is fixed rather than the backend's: they load after
%everything, because a provider is reached through metta_foreign_space/1 and
%not through clause order. That was true before this change and is what made it

%%% What a grounded operation answers when it cannot compute: %%%
%
%MeTTa's error channel is an ANSWER and not an exception. `(Error <call>
%<reason>)` is a value a program can test with if-error, compare with
%assertEqual and pass on, and the FORM AFTER IT STILL RUNS; a raise here ended
%the whole file instead, which is why eleven of the arbiter's grounded
%transcripts stopped at their first probe. So an operation handed an argument
%it cannot use answers, and which answer is decided by the argument's own type:
%
%  - a type the parameter RULES OUT is `(BadArgType <position> <expected>
%    <actual>)`, one answer per rejected actual type, positions left to right
%  - an argument whose type does not DECIDE, %Undefined% or a symbol declared
%    the right type but carrying no value, is the operation's own refusal: its
%    message where upstream gives it one, and otherwise the call left as
%    written, which is upstream's NoReduce

%nested additions and holds compilation to at most double the work for double
%the depth [tested: translator_translation_depth:
%every_nesting_shape_compiles_in_linear_work].

%One lookup per argument answers what the refusal needs: a literal carries its
%own type, a call carries its head's declared RETURN type, and a symbol carries
%what was declared for it. Nothing else is decided, and an argument this cannot
%type is an argument the check accepts, so the compile-time decision is a

%An arithmetic operand is a number. Everything else is refused here, before

%
%Two things came through that door. A MeTTa expression IS a Prolog list, and
%SWI reads a one-element list as a character code, so (+ 1 (g)) quietly
%answered 104, the code of g, and (* 2 (z)) answered 244: a symbol's SPELLING
%became a number, while the two-element case raised.
%
%Worse, Prolog's evaluable atoms silently outranked MeTTa. With (= pi 3.14)
%defined, (+ 1 pi) answered 4.141592653589793 from SWI's constant rather than
%4.14 from the user's own equation. A constant belongs in a MeTTa library as
%an ordinary rewrite, (= (my-pi) 3.14), which reduces before arithmetic sees
%it and now wins because nothing shadows it.
%
%Nobody chose either behaviour; both fall out of is/2. The whole corpus, 169
%programs including the ones passing inf and nan around, is unaffected
%[tested: metta_arithmetic_operands].
%An unbound operand is left to is/2, which raises instantiation_error for it,
%the answer Prolog and ISO both give; refusing it as a type error here would
%report a missing value as a wrong one.
%Both operands in one call: the inline type tests are free, the call is not,
%so checking them separately cost two inferences per operation instead of one
%[measured 2026-08-15: alpha-unique +200,010 against +100,005].

%The guard the declaration above states, enforced at the predicate's own door
%rather than through typed dispatch, which is what runtime_type_guarded/1
%means and what keeps the cost near zero: the common case is two literals and
%a first-argument-indexed type lookup.
%
%EXPRESSIONS ARE EXCLUDED, because the two references disagree about them and
%nothing here should pick a side that neither of them agrees on. Measured
%2026-08-19: hyperon answers False for (== () 1), (== "s" ()) and
%(== (1 2) (1 2 3)) while LeaTTa raises BadArgType for the first two and
%answers False for the third. Both answer False for (== (1 2 3) ()) and
%(== (1 2) (a b)), which is the shape a MeTTa program actually writes, so the
%collapse-and-compare idiom is untouched either way.
%TWO TIERS, because asking the type system costs 26 inferences and a program
%compares literals in a loop. Two operands of the same intrinsic kind settle
%it with one type test and no lookup, which is the case a loop writes; only a
%pair the kinds do not settle pays for a declaration
%[measured 2026-08-19: a thousand-iteration == loop is 4487.45 inferences
%unguarded, 30514.55 with the lookup on every call, and 4990.45 with this

%of 26.03].

%The prelude tier comes LAST in each clause, so a declaration a program
%writes for the same name wins over the engine's prelude, the order the
%type surface already keeps for get-type. The my-if tutorial mechanism is
%what this tier carries: an Atom parameter declared in engine/prelude.metta
%masks that argument at every call site, which is how the prelude's
%assertEqualToResult receives its expected set unevaluated.
%In the user clause the prelude branch comes FIRST, and the order is
%about determinism, not precedence: a first-arg-indexed lookup fails
%fast for every ordinary name, and the disjunction is then EXHAUSTED
%when match/4 yields its last solution, so a raw first-solution caller
%(filereader.plt calls type_declaration/2 bare) is left with exactly the
%choicepoint profile this predicate had before the prelude existed.
%Precedence still belongs to the user because eviction removes the
%prelude's rows the moment &self defines or declares the name, so the
%two stores answer together only when the user has said nothing.
%A module and the space it serves used to be the same atom for every space but

%A declaration that is not an arrow types the SYMBOL and cannot type a call to
%it, and nothing said so. `(: inc Number)` beside `(= (inc $x) (+ $x 1))`
%compiles the call site as bare `inc("s", A)`, so the string travels into `+`
%and the program dies inside arithmetic with `+: number expected`; the same
%file written `(: inc (-> Number Number))` compiles
%`once(has_type("s",'Number') *-> true ; get-metatype(...))` around the call
%and refuses it at inc's own door [reproduced 2026-08-16, both goals are in
%filereader_untypable_declaration].
%
%So this refuses rather than warns. The defect is not that the declaration is
%wrong, it is that the declaration LOOKS like it types the function, does not,
%and every diagnostic the author then gets points somewhere else entirely.
%
%The condition is semantic, not spelling. A first draft rejected any type
%whose head merely LOOKED like a mistyped arrow, and this repository is its
%own counter-example: lib_nars.metta writes NARS inheritance as `(--> $a $b)`
%and lib_combinatorics.metta writes a lambda as `(|-> ...)`, 95 and 48
%occurrences, every one of them a deliberate atom in a data position. What
%decides here is whether the name has an arrow declaration AT ALL, which
%neither of those ever claims to be.
%
%One arrow among several declarations is enough, because MeTTa lets a name
%carry more than one. `%Undefined%` is the engine's own way of writing
%"deliberately untyped" and is not an offender, and neither is a variable,
%which a later binding may still fill.
%
%Judged over a name's WHOLE set of declarations, which is why the caller is
%the source loader and not add-atom/3. A build that writes `(: f Number)` and
%`(: f (-> Number Number))` as two atoms passes through a state where only the
%first is stored, and refusing there refuses a program that is about to be
%correct. Declarations that reach a space by any other route are named by
%space.lint(), which reads the finished space instead of an intermediate one.

%The mechanism is not what the name suggests, and getting that wrong is the

%subtyping relation while checking an argument: it WIDENS the argument's type
%LIST, and the ordinary type check then runs unchanged against the wider list.
%So the matcher learns nothing about subtyping, and `get-type` is the surface
%where it shows [source: LeaTTa ai-report-subtype-graph.md,

%
%What is NOT widened: a grounded literal's built-in type and an application's
%return type, because upstream's get_atom_types_internal queries the space only
%for symbols and expressions. So `(:< Number Foo)` leaves `(get-type 1)` at
%Number, and `(: f (-> A B))` with `(:< B C)` leaves `(get-type (f a))` at B.
%Two phases, because the ORDER is observable through collapse and upstream's
%is not the order one pass produces: tuple products first, then the direct
%declarations already widened, then one more widening over the whole list. With
%(: (a b) D), (:< (A B) C) and (:< D E) that answers ((A B) D E C), where a

%The other half of the metatype answer: the table says which names are grounded

%asks both, `groundedTokenNames.contains s && w.opAdmitted s`, and it measured
%why: hyperon answers Symbol for `flip` and Grounded for it after
%`!(import! &self random)`, because "WHICH names a tokenizer has bound is a

%contradicts the `no-such-operation` answer the same corpus pins: 33 of the 98
%are LeaTTa or hyperon operations PeTTa does not ship [measured 2026-08-20].

%Both of the engine's registers are asked, because a head has meaning here two
%ways and fun/1 alone is not the question: 29 of the translator's special-form
%heads answer false to it, `superpose` and `nop` among them
%[source: metta_translated_head/1 in engine/translator.pl, which is the same
%question the linter asks]. `&self` is in neither register and is always here,
%being the space every program starts in, which is why the arbiter grounds it

%A parameter declared with a METATYPE accepts any atom of that kind, which is
%what makes a variadic constructor declarable: a container has no fixed arity
%and the language's answer for that is `Expression`, which is how HE declares
%`(: superpose (-> Expression Atom))`. Before this, no metatype checked in a
%parameter position at all, so `(: PyList (-> Expression PyList))` typed a call
%to it as the tuple product of its arguments rather than as PyList.
%
%`Atom` accepts everything, and the mechanism is NOT the subtype relation `:<`
%spells even though the tutorial's wording invites that reading. It is one
%equality with a wildcard, and the arbiter quotes the line:
%
%    *typ == ATOM_TYPE_ATOM || *typ == get_meta_type(atom)
%
%[source: LeaTTa tests/semantics/types-meta/00_metatypes.metta, quoting
%hyperon-experimental@3f76dc4 lib/src/metta/types.rs:606-617]. So the check is
%"the parameter is Atom, or it equals this value's metatype", which is what the
%two clauses below are. The tutorial line calling Atom "a supertype for Symbol,
%Expression, Variable, Grounded" is recorded there as tutorial prose that
%"records intent only", and taking it literally would have routed metatypes
%through add_super_types, where they do not belong: no widening happens and
%nothing declares an edge [tested: metta_metatype_parameters]. Issue #611 is
%the developers' own phrasing of the same thing, "Atom is the metatype that is
%the sum of Symbol, Variable, Grounded and Expression".
%
%This is consulted only after the declared types have failed, so a value with a
%matching declaration answers exactly as it did, and a program using none of
%these names never reaches it.

%%%% Walking a compiled body for the effects a cache would hide %%%%

%One walk, shared by everything that may hand back a CACHED answer later.
%Tabling and memoization both do, and both were written with their own idea of
%what is safe: tabling's followed calls and treated everything it did not
%recognise as inert, and memoization's had nothing at all beyond a deny-list of
%names a library could mark volatile. The same body was sound for one and
%unsound for the other with no way to compare the two judgements.
%
%What it answers is the SPACE READS reachable from a root, as read/3 terms, and
%what it refuses is any goal not known pure. The reads are reported rather than
%interpreted, because interpreting them is exactly where the two callers
%differ: tabling resolves each to a storage predicate and invalidates the table
%when that predicate changes, and memoization has no such machinery, so a read
%it cannot invalidate on is a refusal there and ordinary work here.

%A control construct is inert BECAUSE its goal arguments were walked, and not
%because its name is on a list. Those are two different claims and treating
%them as one is what let `collapse` through: the walk descended wrappers only
%at arity ONE, so the findall/3 the translator emits for collapse and the

%%%% Space hooks: the general pre-add mechanism (P12) %%%%
%
%(declare-pre-add! <space> <handler>) claims the pre-add hook on a space
%for one MeTTa function of one argument, the incoming atom. Every write
%into a claimed space consults the handler first, equations and type
%declarations included, and the handler answers exactly one of
%
%    (accept)           the write proceeds with the atom as offered
%    (accept <atom'>)   the write proceeds with the TRANSFORMED atom.
%                       The handler's output is the GRANTED form and is
%                       not re-asked, exactly as a BEFORE trigger's
%                       modified row does not re-fire the trigger: the
%                       claimant has decided this request, and a handler
%                       wanting chained rewriting composes its own
%                       equations in the body
%    (refuse <words>)   the write throws, carrying the handler's words
%    (drop)             the write is silently skipped and the caller
%                       sees success, which set semantics needs
%
%The verdict algebra is a PostgreSQL row-level BEFORE trigger's (return
%NEW, return a modified row, raise, return NULL) and netfilter's
%(ACCEPT, mangle, REJECT, DROP); both draw the same silent-drop versus
%loud-refuse distinction. The refusal carries the handler's OWN
%sentence, the SpaceProvider.refusal pattern at the hook layer. In
%CHR's terms the hook fires at most ONE rule step per request, the
%bounded prefix of the ω_e semantics the arbiter mechanizes over this
%very atom fragment; ω_e itself has no refusal and no stuck state, so
%those belong to this admission door alone
%[source: LeaTTa MettaHyperonFull/Proofs/ChrOperational.lean].
%
%ONE claimant per (space, slot), checked when the claim is made, is the
%interaction-net discipline (Hassan, Mackie and Sato, GT-VMT 2008: at
%most one rule per pair of agents obtains confluence by construction):
%a second claimant is refused at declaration naming both, never raced
%at call time. Pattern-level dispatch belongs to the handler's own
%equations, which is where the critical-pair reporter already names
%overlaps. A claimed handler whose equations do not cover the incoming
%atom is a STUCK STATE and throws saying so, because an active pair
%with no rule is locally detectable; a handler that wants a default
%writes its own catch-all equation, one visible line.
%
%The handler runs in the module CURRENT AT DECLARATION, captured in the
%claim, because everything runs where it was written (evalc/3's own
%principle); its body reaches the hooked space by naming it. A handler
%error propagates to the add site unchanged. The wrapper installs on
%the first claim and an engine that never claims keeps the direct
%write path [tested: a_pre_add_hook_can_refuse_with_its_own_words,
%a_second_claimant_for_one_name_is_refused_with_both_named,
%an_unclaimed_request_is_a_stuck_state_that_says_so].
%The post-add slot mirrors the pre-add slot with the verdicts read
%against a LANDED atom: (accept) keeps it, (accept <atom'>) replaces it
%through the same write path with the replacement granted, (refuse
%<words>) undoes the write and throws, (drop) removes it silently. A
%post handler that errs or sticks also undoes the write first, so an
%errored hook leaves no atom behind. The event pair stays pure
%observation beside it: an observer's answer is discarded and the store
%does not move, which is the difference P12.2 names
%[tested: a_post_add_hook_may_transform_while_the_event_pair_only_observes].

%%% Documentation, HE's vocabulary, first class %%%

%The design stays lib_doc's, which was already the right one:
%documentation is ATOMS IN A SPACE, (@doc name (@desc ...) ...) is data
%a program writes and can reason about, and retrieval is a match. What
%promotion adds is reach and a second tier: these are builtins now, no
%import, they resolve against the CURRENT context rather than literal
%&self, each has a -space twin selecting any space, and get-doc falls
%back to the engine's own register, where the prelude documents its
%vocabulary, so help! answers for engine forms too.
%
%The tier split is deliberate and asymmetric. RESOLVERS (get-doc,
%help!) consult the register, because "what does this name mean" wants
%an answer wherever the name comes from. ENUMERATORS (documented,
%defined-name, undocumented) are program-scoped and skip builtins,
%because "what have I documented" and "what did I forget" are questions
%about the program, and an engine that padded the answer with its own
%vocabulary would bury the user's gap under noise.
%
%The register branch comes FIRST in get-doc for the same determinism
%reason type_declaration_in orders its tiers: a first-arg-indexed miss
%is fast for ordinary names, and the disjunction is exhausted when
%match/4 ends, so raw first-solution callers keep match's own

%The findall INSIDE the limit is what avoids that: the whole enumeration is
%bounded as one unit and member/2 hands the answers back.
%
%Do not be tempted to replace this with a raw alarm/4 around the goal to get

%took SIGSEGV where call_with_time_limit/2 on the identical goal unwound

%module its clause was compiled in, so a module-blind call/1 reaches only user.
%Without this, `!(eval (f 1))` on a function defined in any space other than
%&self raised `call_goals/1: Unknown procedure: f/2` while the same `!(f 1)`
%answered normally, and every named space PyPeTTa creates hit it. lib_he's
%`unify` and the ToResult asserts route their branches through eval, so they
%failed there too [tested: test_per_space.py::test_eval_uses_the_spaces_own_equations].
%There is no unset case any more: current_metta_module/1 answers &self's own
%module when nothing is in force, and a bare call/1 would resolve in the
%ENGINE's module, which is the parent and cannot see a space's clauses. The

%Spelling the branch out here instead was measured and bought nothing
%[measured 2026-08-19: handle-round-trip 1,950,077 either way].
%eval takes its argument as written: &self resolved at the reader if the

%%%% A library declares its own exports, in the file that implements them %%%%
%
%Registering one predicate took three statements in two languages: the name in
%a Python call, the arity discovered by scanning whatever current_predicate/1
%happened to hold, and the type in a third statement whose ordering against
%call-site compilation nothing checked. Nothing kept the three in agreement,
%and the arity was DISCOVERED rather than declared, so a library shipping a
%public 'vec-dot'/3 and an internal helper 'vec-dot'/2 published both.
%
%Every comparable runtime puts the export declaration in the file that
%implements it: PyMethodDef, R_CallMethodDef, ErlNifFunc, napi_property_
%descriptor, SWI's own module/2 export list. R had exactly this engine's
%mechanism, symbol discovery, and walked away from it, because "the use of
%registration allows R to ensure that code compiled into packages does not
%inadvertently call routines in other packages"
%[source: R Extensions manual, section 5.4].
%
%The declaration is MeTTa, in a string, rather than a new Prolog operator. The
%types are MeTTa types, the reader that parses them is the engine's own, and
%the MeTTa arity comes from the type chain, so the arity cannot disagree with
%the type it was written beside:

%
%(export Name Arity) is the form for a name whose type the author does not
%want to state; the arity is the MeTTa arity, one less than the predicate's.

%predicates exist. consult_global/1 and its two siblings are the funnel every
%route enters through, so the MeTTa spelling, register_prolog and a bare

%How much a caller may assume about a function's answers, and therefore what

%within one statement so repeated calls may fold to one, and IMMUTABLE gives
%the same answer forever so a call on constant arguments may be folded at

%
%The gap this closes was demonstrated rather than imagined: lib_memo will
%happily cache a side-effecting registered predicate, because nothing records

%
%SILENCE STAYS PERMISSION. PostgreSQL's default is the pessimistic rung and

%predicate another library loaded: SWI prints "Redefined static procedure" and
%CONTINUES, so the incumbent's clauses are gone before any refusal can speak.
%A directive cannot stop that either, because a directive that throws is
%reported and the load carries on [measured 2026-08-16: with the refusal in

%not a predicate of that name exists, so those two are not registrable.
%
%This walk used to live inside register_fun/1, guarded by "the name is new".
%A library registering 'norm'/3 for a name some space already defined at MeTTa
%arity 1 therefore recorded no arity at all, and incomplete_application_kind/3
%reads a missing arity as "not applied far enough", so (norm a b) compiled to a
%partial application. Reading it here instead means the arities are recorded
%for the registration that asked for them, whatever else knows the name
%[tested: a_registration_records_arities_for_a_name_that_is_already_a_function].
%Every arity the name is CALLABLE at, and callable means defined here rather
%than merely visible. The exclusion is not defensive: library(yall) exports
%//2 through //9 into user as its free-variables lambda, so probing
%current_predicate/1 alone recorded SEVEN arities for `/` where + and * have
%one. (/ 1 2 3) then compiled to a direct '/'(1,2,3,_) call, which is yall's
%lambda, and answered `type_error(lambda_free, 1)` where every other operator
%answers the engine's own function_input_arities naming the operator
%[tested: metta_registration_arities].
%
%imported_from/1 is the exact question, and the arity =< 2 clause below is the

%the engine had to know both that MORK had builtins and what they were called.
%
%Registering a name whose predicate is absent records no arity, and

%every call to it then compiled to a partial application, so (mm2-exec &mork 1)

%
%Without this, `get-type` misreported the engine to every tool that reads it.
%`!=` IS a builtin, IS registered and IS declared (: != (-> $a $b Bool)) in
%lib/lib_builtin_types.metta, but with nothing loading that file
%`(get-type !=)` answered %Undefined% for an operation that works. Nothing was
%missing; the type surface was simply not connected, and a reader like the
%metta-lsp port has no way to tell "this has no type" from "this has a type
%nobody loaded".
%
%FACTS RATHER THAN ATOMS IN &self, and that is the whole design decision.
%Loading the file into &self was tried first and it changes what every program
%SEES OF ITS OWN SPACE: `(match &self (: $what $type) ...)` then answers 41
%engine declarations alongside the program's own, which broke
%tests/regression/repro3_failed_specialization_self_leak.metta immediately.
%The engine's types belong where the type system reads them and nowhere a
%program enumerating its own atoms can trip over them.
%
%LAST, so a user wins. get_type_candidate/2 tries the intrinsic types, the
%function's arrow, the element-wise reading and &self's own declarations
%before reaching here, so `(: + (-> Foo Bar))` written by a program is
%answered ahead of the engine's and this only ever fills a gap.
%
%ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the facts are built by parsing lib_builtin_types.metta
%at boot, so the file a program can still import explicitly and the table the
%engine answers from cannot drift apart.

%%%%%%%%%% The engine's prelude %%%%%%%%%%
%
%engine/prelude.metta holds standard vocabulary promoted from the libraries:
%forms every program may use with no import!, compiled here at startup by
%the same translator that compiles a program's own equations. The clauses
%land in the base tier and each head registers as a builtin, so the names
%are visible from every space and shadowable per named space exactly as
%builtins are; the ATOMS are stored in no space at all, so a program
%enumerating &self sees only its own writes, the same design decision
%load_builtin_type_surface records above for the type surface.
%
%Declarations go to prelude_type_declaration/2, a third register beside
%type_declaration/2 (what the program declared) and
%builtin_type_declaration/2 (the engine's Prolog surface). It is consulted
%on the FUNCTION path, which builtin_type_declaration deliberately is not:
%that register describes arguments a caller writes for predicates
%underneath (the maplist lesson, documented at call_site_type_chains/2),
%while a prelude declaration is an ordinary MeTTa declaration for an
%ordinary compiled equation, so honouring it at call sites is exactly
%right, and it is what makes an Atom parameter like assertEqualToResult's
%arrive unevaluated. A program's own declaration is read first, so a user
%redeclaration wins, the same order the type surface keeps.
%
%Two passes, because the file may use a name before defining it
%(type-cast calls type-cast-holds, defined below it): every equation head
%registers first, then every form compiles, so a forward reference
%compiles as the call it is. The filereader solves the same problem with
%a repair pass; the prelude is small enough to pre-register instead.

%Which names the prelude registered as TRANSLATOR RULES. A derived form ships
%as an equation plus that registration, and the registration is the prelude's
%to withdraw: a program that defines the name itself takes the whole form
%over, and a rule pointing at the program's equations would call them as a
%compile-time expander, which is not what an ordinary definition means.
:- dynamic prelude_translator_rule/1.
%The prelude's equations as TERMS, one row per (= ...) form, so a tool
%can enumerate the shipped tier without re-parsing prelude source: the
%loader compiles equations into &self's module rather than storing atoms
%(get-atoms on a user space must not show engine vocabulary), and this
%register is the enumerable door that compilation would otherwise close.
%The confluence reporter is the first consumer.
:- dynamic prelude_equation/2.
%Which builtin_type_declaration/2 rows the prelude PUT THERE, as opposed to
%found there. The two registers overlap once a name needs its Atom mask
%honoured at call sites AND belongs to the engine's reported type surface:
%get-type is declared by lib_builtin_types.metta and again by engine/prelude.metta,
%for the two different readers. Without this ledger the prelude's eviction
%would retract a row the FILE owns, since the two rows are identical and
%retractall/1 cannot tell them apart.
:- dynamic prelude_wrote_builtin_type/2.

%A user definition WINS over the prelude, entirely. When &self compiles
%an equation for a name the prelude owns, the prelude's clauses and
%declarations for that name are evicted first, so the program's own
%definition answers alone, exactly as it did before the name was
%promoted (examples/types/matchtypes.metta defines its own match-types
%and must keep meaning ITS match-types). Additive answers would be the
%non-exclusive-equations reading, but the prelude is engine vocabulary,
%not part of the program, and the house rule everywhere else on this
%boundary is that the user's word replaces the engine's: get-type reads
%a program's declaration ahead of the surface, prelude_type_declaration
%is consulted last. Eviction is one-way; removing the user's equation
%later does not resurrect the prelude's, the same as redefining any
%function. Named spaces need none of this: their clauses shadow through
%their own module already, the builtin-override rule.
