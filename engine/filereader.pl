% Purpose: read MeTTa source, split it into complete top-level forms, and
% dispatch each parsed form to the evaluator.
% Guarantees:
%   - A parsed form that cannot translate is not reported as a syntax error
%     [tested 2026-08-14: filereader_translation_errors].
%   - top_forms//2 ignores comment text and keeps parentheses inside escaped
%     string quotes inside their form [tested 2026-08-15:
%     filereader_form_splitter].
%   - parse_metta_source/2 consumes comments in its grammars without building a
%     stripped source copy [measured: 7,736,802 versus 8,874,582 inferences for
%     twenty parses of 48,786 codes, 2026-08-15].
%   - Loader diagnostics contain ANSI escapes only on terminal streams
%     [tested 2026-08-14: filereader_terminal_output].
%   - A type declaration that cannot type a function the same source defines
%     is refused before any of that source's forms run [tested 2026-08-16:
%     filereader_untypable_declaration].
%   - A failed source load removes compiler metadata and generated predicates,
%     and does not repair existing callers against definitions that rolled back
%     [tested 2026-08-14: filereader_source_rollback].
%   - Direct source strings compile equations into their target named space
%     [tested 2026-08-14:
%     tracer:function_defined_in_named_trace_stays_in_that_space].
%   - File functions remain a global fallback when a named space defines the
%     same symbol [tested 2026-08-14: filereader_global_function_scope].
%   - prepare_parsed_forms/1 is the ONE definition of what a source does before
%     any of its own forms run, so a reader that parses for itself
%     (bindings/python/petta/shim.pl does, to keep one answer group per directive) gets
%     the same signature set registered up front, and the same refusal of a
%     declaration that cannot type what the source defines, rather than a
%     second copy of either [tested 2026-08-18:
%     test_a_source_registers_every_signature_before_any_form_runs,
%     test_load_memoizes_a_function_the_same_file_defines_lower_down,
%     test_a_declaration_that_cannot_type_what_the_source_defines_is_refused].
%   - That pass costs 31 inferences for a one-form source, identical across
%     three different one-form sources, then 4.006 per plain form and 23.073
%     per definition beyond it [measured 2026-08-18: interleaved A/B over
%     eight benchmark lanes, bindings/python/benchmarks/baseline.json records each].
%   - print_runnable_form/2 and print_function_form/2's trace output, and
%     library(pcre)-backed regex, both work under autoload=false, not only
%     under the engine's default [measured 2026-08-18: NO_AUTOLOAD=1 sh
%     test.sh, the full examples/ corpus].
%   - source_layout//2 skips exactly the characters sread/2 treats as
%     whitespace between atoms, parser.pl's metta_token_boundary/2 layout
%     rows being the one class both read [tested 2026-08-19:
%     test_every_unicode_whitespace_separates_top_level_forms].
%   - A top-level form is ONE ATOM of any kind, so `! untouched-symbol`,
%     `! 42`, `! "text"` and `! &first` run and a bare symbol on its own
%     line is stored, which is what the arbiter does with each. `!` marks
%     the atom after it only before `(`, layout or end of input, and is an
%     ordinary symbol character everywhere else, so `bind!`, `!=`, `!42`
%     and `!$x` are names [tested 2026-08-19: filereader_form_splitter,
%     filereader_bare_top_level_atoms].
%   - Runnable answer groups carry each reader Name-Var map inside the
%     collection template, preserving source variable identity through
%     findall without attributed variables [tested:
%     test_variable_names_survive_to_the_printer; commit=916def0562c211143bb91cd0bd8b2c9dac7ab4fa].
%   - A file that loads again REPLACES what it put in that space rather than
%     adding to it, reaches any other space its change has made stale, and
%     says what it withdrew [tested 2026-08-19:
%     test_a_reloaded_source_replaces_its_definitions_and_says_what_it_replaced,
%     test_a_reload_replaces_the_file_in_every_space_that_holds_it,
%     filereader_source_reload:a_reload_leaves_one_clause_for_a_redefined_function].
%   - The replacement reaches everything derived from the definitions it
%     withdrew, because the atoms leave through metta_remove_atom/3
%     [tested 2026-08-19: test_reloading_invalidates_a_memoized_answer,
%     test_reloading_invalidates_a_tabled_answer,
%     test_reloading_invalidates_a_specialization,
%     test_a_live_view_follows_a_reload].
%   - A reload that raises leaves the previous definitions standing
%     [tested 2026-08-19:
%     test_a_reload_that_fails_leaves_the_previous_definitions_standing].
%   - Replacement is per FILE and reaches nothing another file contributed, so
%     a function two files define still answers twice: that is a name
%     collision and not a reload [tested 2026-08-19:
%     test_a_reload_replaces_that_files_definitions_and_no_others].
%   - "Changed" is answered from the CONTENT, so an edit that keeps a file's
%     length is still an edit where a modification time might not have moved
%     [tested 2026-08-19:
%     filereader_source_reload:an_edit_that_keeps_the_length_is_still_a_change].
%   - Recording what a load contributed costs ONE inference per stored atom,
%     which is one assertz and is what a withdrawal needs to find the atom
%     again, plus about 230 for the load itself. Measured against the same
%     tree without the recording, interleaved, min of three a side, no spread:
%     a 128-equation source 95,396 against 95,165 (+0.24%), and a
%     20,001-atom file 7,381,790 against 7,361,403 through the library's door
%     and 7,322,289 against 7,302,027 through import!'s populate pass, both
%     +0.28%. Asking whether an already-loaded file has changed costs 336, a
%     read and a hash [measured 2026-08-19].
%   - Compiled definitions record their module-qualified symbol supports in
%     supports/2, and a function change queues each transitive compiled caller
%     once for repair [tested:
%     support_graph:test_a_derived_fact_is_invalidated_forward_from_what_it_supports;
%     commit=7ade2b90e2631451fd6ffc23d22dd8c2d4a7a7aa].
%   - A compiled call records the six dispatch-policy roots and every possible
%     DontEvalType marker root that selected its argument evaluation, so a late
%     catalog or marker write repairs stored callers [tested:
%     test_every_dispatch_axis_is_readable_settable_and_defaulted,
%     test_a_user_declared_lazy_type_receives_its_argument_unevaluated;
%     commit=WORKTREE].
% Open Obligations:
%   To Do: None
%   Hacks: None
%   Future Enhancements: the pass walks the form list three times, once per
%     concern, and three of the 4.006 a plain form costs are those walks
%     [measured 2026-08-18: 60,024 inferences over 20,001 forms]. One merged
%     walk would collect all three, but acquire_declared_dependencies/1
%     belongs to lib/lib_gitimport.pl and takes the form list itself, so
%     merging changes a library's interface; left alone here for that reason.

%What a file put where, so that loading it again can REPLACE that rather than
%add to it. SWI states the rule this implements: "clauses are owned by the file
%in which they are defined. This information is used to replace the old
%definition after the file has been modified and is reloaded"
%[source: SWI-Prolog 10.1 Reference Manual, include/1]. Here the owned things
%are whatever the load asserted, which source_load_assertion/2 already lists,
%so the file only needs the key onto that list and the digest of the text it
%was built from.
%
%The list is KEPT as the per-assertion facts the load built it up as, rather
%than collected into one clause holding a list of references. The collected
%form is the smaller of the two, one clause where this pays a clause header
%per atom of every file loaded, and it was tried and rejected on cost: it has
%to walk the accumulator at the end of every load, and that walk cost 80,410
%inferences of the save-load benchmark's 8,502,424 [measured 2026-08-19,
%interleaved A/B, min of three a side]. Keeping the facts costs the load
%NOTHING and takes a walk off it, because the success path used to retract
%them one at a time.
%
%A clause reference is a BLOB of type clause, so holding one keeps its clause
%from being reclaimed and a stale one decodes to nothing rather than to
%whatever later took its place [measured 2026-08-19: erased, then 200,000
%clauses asserted and two clause collections later, the reference still
%decoded to nothing and erase/1 on it failed].

%behaviour, "Fix the sources and reload them using make/0", retry
%[source: SWI-Prolog 10.1 Reference Manual, section 4.3.2]. Two things were
%missing here and they failed in opposite directions. The Python door had no
%file identity at all, so a second load ADDED the file's definitions on top of
%the first and `(answer)` answered 1 and 2; import! had identity but no change
%detection, so a second import was skipped and the edit was ignored. Neither
%said anything [measured 2026-08-19, both doors].
%
%So this is the other half of the lifecycle P11.6 gave a space: clearing a
%space empties its execution module, and loading a file again replaces what
%that file put there. It is not retract-and-assert. The atoms leave through
%metta_remove_atom/3, the funnel that owns every consequence of an atom
%leaving: an equation un-compiles and forgets its name, a declaration
%recompiles the call sites it was shaping, invalidate_specializations/2 drops
%the specializer's clones, metta_on_function_removed/1 drops lib_memo's
%generations and lib_tabling's tables and duals.pl's duals, and
%metta_on_atom_removed/2 tells every LiveView and Python subscription. What no
%atom owns leaves through rollback_source_load/1, the same erase a failed load
%uses, and there is one such thing: a file imported into a NAMED space compiles
%into &self's module while its atoms are stored in that space, so its clauses
%are global where its atoms are not
%[tested: test_a_reloaded_source_replaces_its_definitions_and_says_what_it_replaced,
%test_reloading_invalidates_a_memoized_answer].
%
%Replacement reaches the asking space, and any OTHER space the change has made
%stale. The compiled half is shared for the reason just given, so a file whose
%text has changed cannot be replaced in one space alone: another space still
%holding the old atoms would list definitions the rebuilt module no longer
%answers. A space holding the SAME text is not stale and is left alone, which
%is what keeps loading one file into many spaces linear. The asking space loads
%first, so its pass is the one that compiles; the stale ones are populated
%again after, through LoadInto, called as call(LoadInto, Space).
%
%LoadInto is a parameter because how a file goes into a space is a property of
%the FILE, and the engine is not the only thing that reads one: the Python
%library's trusted fast cache is a serialised space with a format of its own,
%and re-populating one through the MeTTa reader would try to parse its binary
%header. Each door hands in the loader its own format needs.
%
%The withdrawal and the load that follows it are ONE transaction, so a reload
%that raises leaves the previous definitions standing rather than taking them
%with it. This is the difference between a reload being safe to attempt and a
%typo in the source costing the session its program, and the manual makes the
%same point about make/0: "Reloading a previously loaded file is safe, both in
%the debug scenario above and when the code is being executed by another
%thread", where the debug scenario is the fix-and-reload cycle this item is for
%[source: SWI-Prolog 10.1 Reference Manual, section 4.3.2]. transaction/1
%restores an erased clause the same way it discards an asserted one
%[measured 2026-08-19: an erase inside a transaction that then throws left the
%clause answering]. Only the reload path pays it; a first load has nothing to
%protect and does not enter one
