% Purpose: reason about term rewriting systems: rewrite one step, reduce to a
%   normal form, enumerate critical overlaps, order terms by a recursive path
%   order, and complete a set of equations into a convergent system. The
%   compile-time translator rule set is a rewrite system, and this is the
%   machinery that says whether it terminates and whether it is confluent.
%
%   WHAT IT COVERS: REWRITING. Every predicate here is defined over a rewrite
%   relation, and it reaches the compile-time rule set because P2.1 makes a
%   rule head MATCHED rather than called. MeTTa's own evaluation NARROWING is
%   a different relation: with (= (f a) 1) and (= (f b) 2), evaluating (f $x)
%   INSTANTIATES $x and answers both rows [measured 2026-08-18], so the head
%   and the goal unify rather than one being an instance of the other. None of
%   the results here covers that, and engine/narrowing.pl is the file that
%   carries a termination question across the gap.
%
%   This is an ADAPTATION, not a reimplementation. The core is Markus Triska's
%   trs.pl, "Reason about Term Rewriting Systems", written 2015-2022, PUBLIC
%   DOMAIN, tested with Scryer Prolog [source: https://www.metalevel.at/trs/,
%   file https://www.metalevel.at/trs/trs.pl, read 2026-08-19]. What the port
%   to SWI-Prolog 10 changed, and nothing else:
%
%   - library(clpz) becomes library(clpfd). #=/2 is spelled the same in both,
%     so only the import line differs.
%   - library(dcgs), library(iso_ext) and library(format) are dropped: DCG
%     notation and phrase/2 are built into SWI and nothing here uses the other
%     two.
%   - the file becomes a module, which is a fence rather than a fix. Every engine/
%     file the engine loads is consulted into `user`, and step/3, ord/4, lex/4,
%     mul/4, context/3 and group/1 are names generic enough that something
%     there will want one eventually [measured 2026-08-19: none of them is
%     defined in `user` today, so nothing collides yet]. The engine does not
%     load this file; a caller asks for it by name.
%   - critical_pairs//2 becomes overlaps//3, which emits an overlap RECORD
%     naming the two rules and the position instead of the bare pair, and
%     critical_pairs/2 projects the pair back out. A report about a rule set
%     has to say which two rules overlapped and where, and a bare pair cannot.
%     Projecting rather than adding a second enumerator keeps the enumeration
%     defined exactly once, which is what makes the agreement with the Lean
%     enumerator (below) an agreement about the thing completion/5 uses.
%
%   The additions below the ported part carry their own citations and are kept
%   in one section so the port stays diff-able against the original, whose
%   layout and 8-column continuation style this file therefore keeps.
%
%   Its step/3 matches with subsumes_term/2 and then copies with copy_term/2,
%   which is the same matching discipline the engine's own rule heads use: a
%   rule may not bind a variable of the term it is matched against. P2.1 makes
%   MeTTa heads matched rather than called; P2.16 re-checks that match after a
%   guard runs. This is the third place the discipline shows up, and the reason
%   an adopted rewriting library needed no change to fit.
% Assumes:
%   - a rule is L ==> R with variables represented by Prolog variables, so two
%     rules that must not share variables are copy_term/2'd apart before they
%     meet. Every predicate here that brings two rules together does that
%     [source: Triska's own note above the ==> operator].
%   - confluence_check/3 numbers the peak's variables and then compares reducts
%     with =@=/2, so a variable a rule with an extra variable invented on the
%     way does not make two equal terms look different, while the peak's own
%     variables stay distinguishable. rhs_vars_in_lhs/1 is the predicate that
%     says whether a system has such rules at all
%     [tested: tests/prolog/suites/translator/trs.plt,
%     an_invented_variable_does_not_make_a_pair_look_divergent].
%   - overlaps/2 enumerates the same family as
%     MeTTaILProofs.CPExecutable.criticalPairs: every ordered pair of rules at
%     every non-variable position of the first rule's left-hand side, the root
%     included, with the second rule renamed apart. Positions are counted from
%     1 here and from 0 there, which is the one difference. Agreement is
%     measured over 84 systems, 24 written for the shapes that separate the two
%     enumerators and 60 generated
%     [tested 2026-08-19:
%     test_the_two_enumerators_compute_the_same_critical_pairs].
% Guarantees:
%   - critical_pairs/2, step/3, normal_form/3, rpo/5, completion/5,
%     equations_trs/2 and equations_order/2 behave as the original does.
%     equations_trs/2 turns the three group axioms into the documented 10-rule
%     convergent system [tested: tests/prolog/suites/translator/trs.plt,
%     the_group_axioms_complete_to_the_documented_ten_rules].
%   - normal_form/3 MAY NOT TERMINATE. That is the original's own wording and
%     its counter-example is kept: with R = { a ==> a, f(X) ==> b } the term
%     f(a) does have a normal form, and normal_form/3 does not find it, because
%     it reduces arguments first and a is its own reduct. Nothing here hides
%     that behind a fuel parameter; bounded_join/4 is the bounded predicate and
%     it says so in its name
%     [tested: tests/prolog/suites/translator/trs.plt,
%     normal_form_loops_on_the_documented_counter_example].
%   - overlaps/2 and critical_pairs/2 enumerate the SAME family, because
%     critical_pairs/2 is a projection of overlaps/2 rather than a second
%     enumerator
%     [tested: tests/prolog/suites/translator/trs.plt, critical_pairs_is_a_projection_of_overlaps].
% Decides:
%   - a bound is an argument, never a constant. reachable_up_to/4,
%     bounded_join/4 and confluence_check/3 all take their fuel from the
%     caller, so an `unknown` is always attributable to a number the caller
%     chose.
% Open Obligations:
%   To Do: None
%   Hacks: None
%   Future Enhancements: None

   certified counterexample (two DISTINCT normal forms, which no further
   rewriting can join), or unknown (the bounded search missed and at least one
   side still has a reduct). The three-way split is the Lean side's
   ConfluenceCheck, and keeping `unknown` apart from `counterexample` is what
   stops a bound the caller chose from reading as a negative result.

   The peak's own variables are numbered before the search, which is what makes
   =@=/2 the right comparison rather than a sloppy one. Two reducts of the same
   peak may differ only in variables that a rule with an extra variable made up
   on the way, and those ARE the same term; the peak's own variables are not
   interchangeable and numbering them says so. With no extra variables in the
   system both sides of every pair are ground after numbering, =@=/2 collapses
   to ==/2, and the answers are the Lean side's exactly. */
